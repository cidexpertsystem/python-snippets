# The pixels in an input image are represented as integers.
# This algorithm distorts the input image in the following way:
# Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average
# value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x,
# including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

# Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
